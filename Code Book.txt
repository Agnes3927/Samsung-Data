The run_analysis.R is the R script of preparing tidy_data.


Step 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	-get the test data for x and Y and subject test data
	-get the train data for x and y and subject train data
	- bind the test data and train data into one data set

Step 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Step 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Step 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

Step 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
